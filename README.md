# Torch VGGish
A PyTorch port of [VGGish](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/audioset)<sup>1</sup>, 
a feature embedding frontend for audio classification models. The weights are ported directly from the tensorflow model, so embeddings created using `torchvggish` will be identical.
