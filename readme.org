* PyTorch-VGGish
Citation: https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub45611

To get started clone this repo, make sure you're running a python 3
environment with pytorch installed, and run `python vggish.py`. This
will download the weights for the convolutional features part of
VGGish and report the model architecture. If you are on MacOS / Linux,
the weights will be installed to `~/.torch/models`, so you do not have
to download them again.

Please note: this is a work in progress. Currently the PyTorch-VGGish
model does not produce 128-d embeddings like the Tensorflow
model. This is a part of the project I am actively working on.

** Tasklist
*** DONE Download tensorflow model weights from [[https://storage.googleapis.com/audioset/vggish_model.ckpt][here]].
*** DONE Reconstruct TF-slim model in PyTorch.
Mostly done. Cannot get the conversion from Conv layers to fully
connected layers to play nice.
**** TODO figure out why the flattening layer doesn't play nice in PyTorch
*** TODO Convert VGGish utility functions to PyTorch (such as log-mel-STFT etc)
*** TODO Write PyTorch Dataset wrapper for AudioSet embeddings + raw audio recordings

** VGGish Architecture
*Note: only up to layer 10 is currently working in PyTorch. Use
[[https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/audioset][TensorFlow AudioSet]] instead to get up and running with embeddings
straight away!*
