* PyTorch-VGGish
Citation: https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub45611

To get started clone this repo, make sure you're running a python 3
environment with pytorch installed, and run `python vggish.py`. This
will download the weights for the convolutional features part of
VGGish and report the model architecture. If you are on MacOS / Linux,
the weights will be installed to `~/.torch/models`, so you do not have
to download them again.

Please note: this is a work in progress. Currently the PyTorch-VGGish
model does not produce 128-d embeddings like the Tensorflow
model. This is a part of the project I am actively working on.

** VGGish Architecture
*Note: only up to layer 10 is currently working in PyTorch. Use [[https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/audioset][TensorFlow AudioSet]] instead to get up and running with embeddings straight away*
